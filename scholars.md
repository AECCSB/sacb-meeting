We are seeking applications for the 2025 SACB Scholars Program, which will support travel fellowships covering all travel, lodging, food, and conference costs.

**[Apply here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1TdMLVCdFDXc2Mt2SIGTuo3BPd-LrlujiinbvCdxLozc/edit)**

The SACB conference is committed to increasing the inclusion of early-career trainees in the cancer systems biology community. By promoting attendance at the meeting, we hope that trainees will:

+ gain exposure to cancer systems biology
+ network informally with cancer systems biology researchers
+ learn about future opportunities for graduate school, postdoctoral research, and industry/academic jobs

In an effort to expand opportunities, the 2025 SACB Scholars program will support trainees with funding for conference registration and travel, and will provide a one-on-one, peer mentor to facilitate inclusion in conference activities. Ideal candidates include undergraduate students, graduate students, and postdocs. Applicants who identify as members of historically underrepresented racial and ethnic groups (Black/African American, Latino/a, Native American, Native Pacific Islander), who have disabilities that limit major life activities, or who identify as women or non-binary gender are strongly encouraged to apply to the SACB Scholars program. Applicants must either be majoring or conducting research (for postdoctoral scholars) in a science, technology, engineering, mathematics, or medical field.

SACB Scholar applicants are not required to have submitted a scientific abstract to the meeting. Instead, a brief essay is required describing the applicantâ€™s interest in attending the SACB conference and in cancer systems biology more generally. No prior cancer systems biology research experience is required or expected. Applicants will be asked how they self-identify or otherwise contribute to diversity and inclusion efforts.

Due to limited funding to support travel expenses, priority will be given to applicants from the United States.

The application deadline for essay submission is **Friday, Nov. 1, 2024**.

We will notify all applicants of their application's status by **Dec. 1, 2024**.
