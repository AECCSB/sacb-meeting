### Abstract Submission

Abstract submission is now open! We are accepting abstracts.

The format of the poster session is evolving with the move to a virtual meeting format. Each poster will be provided a webpage for display of the poster abstract, a 3-5 minute video, the actual poster, and a question and answer section. Selected abstracts will be invited to provide a longer full talk during the scientific sessions. The poster session will be held inbetween the scientific sessions. Poster prizes will be awarded.

Please note that abstract submission is separate from registering for the meeting. The meeting will be held in an virtual format, so registration will be open soon.
